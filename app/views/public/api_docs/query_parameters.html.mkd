Query parameters and parameterized requests
===========================================

The Madek API uses request parameters e.g. for filtering purposes. Internet
standards specify a *searchpart* of a url and also mention parameters in form
of key-value pairs (see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4>). More
complex structures, like arrays or maps, as well as arbitrary values are not
defined by agreed standards. 

The Madek API requieres for some queries the use of the mentioned more complex
structures. The decoding is then performed by the underlying *Ruby on Rails*
framework. Therefore the *Ruby on Rails* [documentation][] should be the
reference for encoding structured data.
